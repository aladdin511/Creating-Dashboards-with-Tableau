# Creating-Dashboards-with-Tableau
Investigating US flights database using Tableau visualizations.
# Description
In this project, we'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. We will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Our work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.<br>
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in files.

The file you must use in creating your data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.
